    "This assignment transitions you from NumPy's numerical array operations to Pandas' powerful tabular data manipulation. While NumPy excels at homogeneous numerical arrays, Pandas is designed for the heterogeneous, labeled data that characterizes most real-world datasets—mixing dates, categories, numbers, and text within the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work with real bike share data from Chicago's Divvy system to answer questions about urban transportation patterns. Through three progressively complex problems—exploring usage patterns, analyzing rider behavior, and conducting temporal analysis—you'll discover why Pandas has become the standard tool for data analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment emphasizes Pandas' design philosophy: named column access, explicit indexing methods (loc/iloc), handling missing data, and method chaining for readable data pipelines. You'll also see how Pandas builds on NumPy while adding the structure and convenience needed for practical data science work.\n",

    "1. It had originally assigned object to both of these. With the date columns being objets and not datetime, there are certain operations that would not work. As for member_casual, the dtype being object rather than category will use an unnecessarily large amount of memory.\n",
    "2. They are likely produced on behalf of some type of algorithm and designed to be an unique identifier for each station.\n",
    "3. Method chaining is combining multiple methods into a \"chain\" that are completed in the order they are read. For example, df.isna().sum() takes the data frame (df), finds the na values and returns true or false values, and then finds the sum of all true values.\n",
    "4. Depending on how this data was collected, it's possible that either the coordinates were automatically collected but the station names had to be manually typed in and 10% of people did not type them, or it's also possible that not every starting location was at a station. When you think about these e-bikes and scooters, occasionally they are left on sidewalks or corners, which wouldn't be an assigned station, but would still have coordinates attached geographically. Depending on what the reasoning is for the misaligned data and what resources I have, I might do a search and report function to back fill the missing rows in relation to other stations already reported."

When you're using the pipeline for so many different options you're incredibly vulnerable to mistyping something and not noticing. Aside from that, using isin also allows you to link back to a separate list which could be fed from another function or analysis, which allows you to be more flexible in the problems you solve.\n",
    "2. Without initalizing originally, you could find yourself using incorrect logic or filtering incorrectly without noticing. If you assigned things in a different order, like if you were to use an if elif else loop in base python, you open yourself up to opportunities with logic errors where everything becomes morning rush or evening rush.\n",
